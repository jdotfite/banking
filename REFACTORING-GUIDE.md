# Banking App Refactoring Guide

This guide outlines the refactoring suggestions for the banking app to reduce code duplication, improve reusability, and enhance maintainability.

## 1. Unified Banking Data Provider

### Overview

We've created a new `UnifiedBankingDataProvider` that combines the functionality of both `BankingDataProvider` and `EnhancedBankingDataProvider`. This consolidation eliminates duplicate code for data loading, caching, and filtering, providing a single source of truth for banking data.

### Implementation

The new provider is located at `components/context/UnifiedBankingDataProvider.tsx` and includes:

- Proper TypeScript typing that matches the actual data structure
- Combined functionality from both previous providers
- Enhanced error handling and loading states
- Additional features like cache clearing
- Improved type safety

### How to Use

To replace the existing providers with the unified provider:

1. Open `app/layout.tsx` or wherever the providers are currently set up
2. Replace the existing providers with the new unified provider:

```tsx
// Before
<UserProvider>
  <BankingDataProvider>
    <EnhancedBankingDataProvider>
      {children}
    </EnhancedBankingDataProvider>
  </BankingDataProvider>
</UserProvider>

// After
<UserProvider>
  <UnifiedBankingDataProvider>
    {children}
  </UnifiedBankingDataProvider>
</UserProvider>
```

3. Update imports in components that use the banking data:

```tsx
// Before
import { useBankingData } from '@/components/preloaders/BankingDataPreloader';
// or
import { useEnhancedBankingData } from '@/components/preloaders/EnhancedBankingDataProvider';

// After
import { useBankingData } from '@/components/context/UnifiedBankingDataProvider';
```

4. Update component code to use the new hook:

```tsx
// Before (with EnhancedBankingDataProvider)
const { userData, isLoading } = useEnhancedBankingData();

// After
const { userData, isLoading } = useBankingData();
```

### Benefits

- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminates duplicate data loading and processing logic
- **Simplified Component Tree**: Reduces the number of context providers
- **Improved Type Safety**: Better TypeScript typing that matches the actual data structure
- **Enhanced Features**: Adds cache clearing and better error handling
- **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for banking data

## Additional Refactoring Suggestions

### 2. Create a Reusable Animation Component

Multiple components use React Spring with similar configurations. Create a reusable `AnimatedElement` component to standardize animations.

### 3. Create a Unified Bottom Sheet Component

The `TransactionContainer` and `SimpleDraggableSheet` have similar dragging functionality. Create a unified `BottomSheet` component.

### 4. Extract Icon Mapping to a Separate File

Move the icon mappings from the `Icon` component to a separate configuration file.

### 5. Create a Transaction Context

Create a dedicated context for transaction-related state and logic.

### 6. Create Reusable UI Components

Extract repeated UI patterns into reusable components like `Card` and `IconButton`.

### 7. Create Custom Hooks for Common Logic

Extract common logic into custom hooks like `useTransactionData` and `useBottomSheetPosition`.

### 8. Standardize Styling Patterns

Create a theme file with common values to ensure consistent styling.

### 9. Implement Proper TypeScript Typing

Fix type assertions and improve type safety throughout the codebase.

### 10. Optimize Data Loading

Implement proper data fetching with SWR or React Query for better performance and UX.
