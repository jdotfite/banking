PWA Fixes Applied:

1. Added manifest link to _document.tsx
2. Removed duplicate manifest.json from root directory
3. Updated RegisterServiceWorker.tsx with simplified and consistent service worker registration
4. Fixed PWAInstallPrompt.tsx component to better handle install events
5. Created a test page at /test-pwa.html to verify PWA functionality

Next Steps:
1. Run your Next.js development server
2. Navigate to /test-pwa.html in Chrome to verify PWA detection
3. Check Chrome's Application tab in DevTools to ensure manifest is detected
4. If issues persist, verify the manifest and service worker are being correctly served
